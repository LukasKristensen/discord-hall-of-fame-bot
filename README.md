# Discord Hall Of Fame Bot
The purpose of the bot is to monitor the maximum amount of message reactions and repost the message to a board if it surpasses a threshold value. Unlike star bots, this bot is not limited to one emoji but will prompt any emoji reactions.

## Custom Emoji Whitelist
A custom emoji filter can be applied to the bot, so that it will only look for emojis configured to the server.
  - To enable it: ``/custom_emoji_check_logic``
  - Adding emojis to the whitelist: ``/whitelist_emoji``
  - Removing emojis from the whitelist: ``/unwhitelist_emoji`` or ``/clear_whitelist``
